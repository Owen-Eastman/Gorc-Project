
In each of your individual checklists, write down everything that you have added to the project so far at any point.

Try to add the exact name of the file as well so that it can be accessed quickly in the search bar.

This will make it easier for everyone to have tabs on who has added what to the project for whenever one of us
might need something, and so we have an idea on what needs to be added next.
